# Dumb Mines
### The most exciting minesweeper version on your terminal

This repository contains a version of the game *the minesweeper*.<br/>
Some lessons at University were really boring that we started playing the version installed by default on our linux version.<br/>
Once we mastered it, we came up with the idea of developing our own version of the game.<br/>
The project was thought to be the fisrt step of a bigger that we wanted to carry on setting up a graphic user interface and then training an AI able to win efficiently the board.<br/>
Unfortunately we are stuck at the first step (you know, exams at University, other projects going on...).<br/>
If you want to contribuite with some new stuff feel totally free to contact us or to fork something good.<br/>
If you just want to play the game instead, clone or download this repository and run **python game.py** on your command line.<br/>
Enjoy getting blown :3 <br/>
